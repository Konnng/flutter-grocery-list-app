A simple Grocery List written in Flutter.

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view our online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).

## Road Map

* add list filtering
* add drag'n drop
* add option to share grocery list.
* remove emojis from a grocery item (there is no sense put a emoji, right?).
* add options panel with basic options like Theme's color and such.
* Language Support (i18n).
* Refactory code to follow Flutter best practices.
* Unit Tests (!!)

## Local Development
